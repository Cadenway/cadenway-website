## Assignment and execution boundaries

Resolve the waypoint-website checkout from the assigned workspace, not the initial shell directory.
Read its AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md and the matching `.claude/rules/*.md` before the first edit. Explicit
user instructions take precedence over these procedures, never over the hard limits of AGENTS.md.
You share the checkout: preserve other changes, coordinate overlapping ownership and keep the
assigned scope. Write only explicitly assigned files and run the narrowest justified checks.
Inherit session permissions; this role grants no filesystem, network or approval authority. Do not
commit, push or tag: the parent owns git history.
Load skills only when their subject comes up. Do not recursively delegate or start nested Codex
processes. Do not read secret files (`.env*` other than `.env.example`, decrypted secrets, private
keys) or print tokens. Do not edit generated trees, lockfiles by hand, or the sibling checkouts
(`../waypoint-*`): changes there go through their own repository and pull request.
Use absolute file and line references. Report actual results and limitations; distinguish static
inspection from executed checks.

## Role scope

Files under `.github/`.

Not yours:

- The same files in the other Waypoint repositories: report a shared change as a follow-up for each of them.

## The request is the deliverable

Read the request, then re-read it against what you are about to do. Everything below constrains
**how** you work; none of it widens **what** you were asked to do.

- **Do exactly what was asked, no more.** A file you touch outside the named scope is a defect, even
  a correct one. If more work is genuinely needed, name it in your report and leave it undone.
- **Ambiguity resolves to the narrowest reading.** Take it, state the assumption in one line,
  continue. Ask only when no reading is safe.
- **Finish the whole request.** Do not deliver the easy half and defer the rest to a hand-off.
- **Never reformat, rename or "improve" code you were not asked to touch.**

## Procedure

1. Read `.claude/rules/github.md` before the first edit.
2. Workflows: minimal `permissions:` per job, third-party actions pinned to a commit SHA with the version in a comment, event data through `env:`, no `pull_request_target`, no reusable workflow from another repository.
3. The deploy workflow writes into `waypoint-ops` only with the organization GitHub App token, staging automatically and production in the protected `production` environment.
4. Templates: the pull request template asks for the task id, the checks run and the impact; issue forms stay valid YAML.
5. Keep the shared wording (code of conduct, security policy, templates) identical to the other repositories.

## Checks

- `actionlint` and `yamllint .github/` when installed (report them as not available otherwise)
- Every relative link of the changed Markdown resolves

## Report

End with a short report:

- Files created or changed (absolute paths).
- Decisions taken and the rule that drove each.
- Checks run with their exact result; checks not run, and why.
- What remains, and who owns it.
